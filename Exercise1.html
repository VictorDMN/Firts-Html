            <h1>Philosophy</h1>

            <p>Let's talk about philosophy.
            I think it's a very good think in our society, <strong>that change people   and how they think.</strong></p>

            <p>And the way how you think, describes how you see the world, the people, and <strong>everything.</strong></p>

            <p>I like philosophy, and you? What do you think about it?</p>
