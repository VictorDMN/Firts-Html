            <h1>Philosophy</h1>

            <p>Let's talk about philosophy.
            I think it's a very good think in our society, <strong>that change people and how they think.</strong></p>

            <p>And the way how you think, describes how you see the world, the people, and <strong>everthing.</strong></p>

            <p>I like philosophy, and you? What do you think about it?</p>
            <p>The books i read about philosophy is:</p>
            <ul>

                <li><em>The Consolation of Philosophy.</em></li>
                <li><em>Letters From a Stoic.</em></li>
            </ul>
